# Scanner-Recorder
Source code for the old Scanner Recorder for Windows 95 through Windows XP. As it was the day I stopped modifying it. Have fun with it if anyone wants to work on it again after all these years.

By the way, Scanner Recorder Pro was a WAY BETTER internal design that I'll also post here. It makes this old thing look like crap. Lol
