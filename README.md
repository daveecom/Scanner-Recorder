# Scanner-Recorder
Source code for the old Scanner Recorder for Windows 95 through Windows XP. As it was the day I stopped modifying it. Have fun with it if anyone wants to work on it again after all these years.

By the way, Scanner Recorder Pro was a WAY BETTER internal design that I'll also post here. It makes this old thing look like crap. Lol

I just found out that this version still works on the newer Windows systems. Never mind what I said above.

NOTE: This was my very first Windows program I ever wrote. I eventually wrote TONS of Windows code for my job and the other SRPro version too. So they are better designed than this thing.
