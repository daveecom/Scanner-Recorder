# Scanner-Recorder
Source code for the old Scanner Recorder for Windows 95 through Windows 10. As it was the day I stopped modifying it. Have fun with it if anyone wants to work on it again after all these years.

NOTE: This was the very first Windows program I ever wrote. I eventually wrote TONS of Windows code for my job and the other SRPro version too. So they are better designed than this thing.
You'll see the name ADAR (All Day Audio Recorder) all over the place inside the source. That was the original name. It was changed (on the outside) to Scanner Recorder because a user suggested that name and I liked it. ADAR is Scanner Recorder.
